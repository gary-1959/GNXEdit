<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>GNXEdit is an editor and librarian program for use with the DigiTech GNX1 guitar effects processor.</p>
<p>The functionality of the program is similar to the DigiTech GENEdit program for Windows, 
    but includes enhanced library functionality and is cross-platform (Windows and Linux).</p>
<p>The program is written in Python and leverages the QT GUI framework. It iscompletely open source and freely
    available at {APP_GITHUB_LINK}.</p>

<h3>System Exclusive</h3>
<p>There was no information available from DigiTech detailing the System Exclusive commands, so to write
    the program the System Exclusive protocol had to be reverse engineered by snooping on communications 
    between the GENEdit program and a GNX1 device. This work has been documented separately
    and is available in another GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/gary-1959/Digitech-GNX1-System-Exclusive" 
    target="_blank">https://github.com/gary-1959/Digitech-GNX1-System-Exclusive</a>.</p>
<p>There are gaps in this knowledge and any contribution to filling these gaps (or errors) will be
    most gratefully received and incorporated imto the document.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<h4>Windows</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Download and install Python (minimum version 13.2) if not already installed from 
        <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows">https://www.python.org/downloads/windows</a></a></li>
    <li>If you are familiar with GitHub Desktop, use this to clone the repository <a href="https://github.com/gary-1959/GNXEdit">at https://github.com/gary-1959/GNXEdit</a>.<br>
      If not,
    download the repository from <a href="https://github.com/gary-1959/GNXEdit/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">https://github.com/gary-1959/GNXEdit/archive/refs/heads/main.zip</a> and unzip (extract) it into a location of your choice.
    This folder can be located anywhere in your system.</li>
    <li>Open a command terminal and cd into this folder. You should see a folder named &quot;src&quot;.</li>
    <li>Python works best when applications are run in their own dedicated environment. A Python environment
        is simply a folder which contains the main Python program and all the dependant libraries. Create an environment with the following command:
        <code>python -m venv .venv</code> Select the version 13.2 (or later) Python interpreter if prompted.</li>
    <li>Activate the Python environment with the following command (note the dot before venv):<code>.venv\Scripts\activate</code>You should now see (.venv) at the start of the command prompt, indicating that the environment has been activated.</li>
    <li>Install the dependant libraries with the command <code>pip install -r src\requirements.txt</code></li>
    <li>Deactivate the Python environment with the command <code>deactivate</code></li>
</ol>
