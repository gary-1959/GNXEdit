<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>GNXEdit is an editor and librarian program for use with the DigiTech GNX1 guitar effects processor.</p>
<p>The functionality of the program is similar to the DigiTech GENEdit program for Windows, 
    but includes enhanced library functionality and is cross-platform (Windows and Linux).</p>
<p>The program is written in Python and leverages the QT GUI framework. It iscompletely open source and freely
    available at {APP_GITHUB_LINK}.</p>

<h3>System Exclusive</h3>
<p>There was no information available from DigiTech detailing the System Exclusive commands, so to write
    the program the System Exclusive protocol had to be reverse engineered by snooping on communications 
    between the GENEdit program and a GNX1 device. This work has been documented separately
    and is available in another GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/gary-1959/Digitech-GNX1-System-Exclusive" 
    target="_blank">https://github.com/gary-1959/Digitech-GNX1-System-Exclusive</a>.</p>
<p>There are gaps in this knowledge and any contribution to filling these gaps (or errors) will be
    most gratefully received and incorporated imto the document.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<h4>Windows</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Download and install Python (minimum version 13.2) if not already installed from 
        <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows">https://www.python.org/downloads/windows</a></li>
    <li>Download and install the GitHub comman line interface (CLI) from 
        <a href="https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/download/v2.65.0/gh_2.65.0_windows_386.zip">https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/download/v2.65.0/gh_2.65.0_windows_386.zip</a></a></li>
    <li>Open a command window, create a local folder called "GNXEdit" and cd into it</li>
    <li>Create a sub-folder of GNXEdit and call it "program". Clone the GitHub repository at {APP_GITHUB_LINK} into it
        with the following command:<code>gh repo clone gary-1959/GNXEdit</code></li>
    <li>Python works best when applications are run in their own dedicated environment. A Python environment
        is simply a folder which contains the main Python program and all the dependant libraries.
        Create a folder for your Python environment with the following command:
        <code>python -m venv env</code> Select the version 13.2 (or later) Python interpreter if prompted.</li>
    <li>Activate the Python environment with the command <code>env\Scripts\Activate.ps1</code></li>
    <li>Install the dependant libraries with the command <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></li>
    <li>Deactivate the Python environment with the command <code>deactivate</code></li>
</ol>
